        How RCV is counted: Ballots are counted in elimination rounds. In each round, your vote goes to the candidate you ranked highest, 
        if possible. If no candidate has a majority of remaining votes the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated. 
        If your vote is unable to transfer, it will not be counted in later rounds. If a candidate has a majority of remaining votes 
        in a round, they are elected.

    score_higher_than_runoff_title: Why is the top scoring candidate different from the winner?
    score_higher_than_runoff_text: |
      The top-scoring candidate often matches the runoff winner, but not always. 
      In the runoff, only the most preferred votes count, which can shift the outcome. 
      For example, a 5 vs. 4-star vote has less impact in scoring but counts fully in the runoff, 
      while a 5 vs. 0-star vote makes a big difference in scoring but is equal in the runoff. 
      The runoff winner comes out on top because more voters prefer them over the runner-up.
    # Alternate Text:
    # The top-scoring candidate usually matches the winner in the runoff, but not always. 
    # The runoff round counts only the votes for the candidate a voter most prefers, which can lead to different weightings than in the scoring round. 
    # For example, a slight preference (like 5 vs. 4 stars) has a small impact in scoring but counts as one full vote in the runoff. 
    # Conversely, a strong preference (like 5 vs. 0 stars) makes a big difference in scoring but carries the same weight in the runoff. 
    # Ultimately, the runoff winner becomes the final winner because they are preferred by more voters over the runner-up.

    Choosing not to score a candidate is identical to giving that candidate a zero.
    However the voter's decision still gives us sense for the candidates they're
    most familiar with.

  score_range_title: Range of Scores
  score_range_sub_title: Difference between maximum and minimum score on ballots
  score_range_warning: > 
    In order to have a maximum impact on the scoring round of STAR Voting, voters need to 
    follow the instructions on the ballot and indicate at at least one zero (or blank),
    and at least one five. This would result in a range of 5 for the voters scores.


    That said their ballot will still make a full impact during the automatic runoff where 
    the voter's full vote goes to whichever candidate they ranked higher.


    Voters who didn't use the full range, either didn't understand the instructions or chose
    to use a smaller range on purpose. This could be as a protest vote expressing that no candidates deserve 5 stars,
    or it could be the opposite choosing to express that they have a postive opinion of everyone.


    Note that not the consequences for not following the instructions are relatively minor, whereas failing to follow
    the instructions in RCV could get your ballot thrown out (like giving multiple candidates your first choice). Voters
    are also far more likely to use the full range in political elections where voters have a strong opinion.
